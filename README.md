# Navigon

**Navigon** is a 2D shape-based game where the player must escape a maze without getting caught.

**Status:** Under development

A temporary demo version is available (`temp.cpp`) to give an idea of how the final game will look.

---

## Requirements

* C++ compiler (g++)
* SFML library

---

## Build & Run (Linux)

Compile the demo file:

```bash
g++ temp.cpp -o gametemp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./gametemp
```

---

## Notes

* `temp.cpp` is **only a demo**
* The final game will include more features, better mechanics, and improved visuals
